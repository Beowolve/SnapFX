# Release Readiness Status

SnapFX follows a release-ready development track before the first stable `1.0.0` cut.

## Current Position

- `v0.5.0` released: JavaDoc completeness baseline delivered.
- `v0.6.0` released: Docusaurus docs portal + hosted API docs baseline delivered.
- `v0.6.1` scope (in progress): content expansion for user guide/tutorial/examples.
- `0.7.x`: packaging hardening (cross-platform validation, checksums, smoke workflow polish).
- `0.8.x`: publishing readiness (Maven Central staging/signing/release flow).
- `0.9.x`: release rehearsal and API freeze.
- `1.0.0`: stable cut after all release-readiness gates are green.
